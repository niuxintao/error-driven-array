Combinatorial testing(CT) seeks to handle potential faults caused by various interactions of factors that can influence the Software systems. When applying CT, it is a common practice to first generate a bunch of test cases to cover each possible interaction and then to locate the failure-inducing interaction if any failure is detected. Although this conventional procedure is simple and straightforward, we conjecture that it is not the ideal choice in practice. This is because 1) testers desires to isolate the root cause of failures before all the needed test cases are generated and executed 2) the early located failure-inducing interactions can guide the remaining test cases generation, such that many unnecessary and invalidate test cases can be avoided. For this, we propose a novel CT framework that allows for both generation and localization process to better share each other's information, as a result, both this two testing stages will be more effectively and efficiently when handling the testing tasks. We conducted a series of empirical studies on several open-source software, of which the result shows that our framework can locate the failure-inducing interactions more quickly than traditional approaches, while just needing less test cases.
%When the system under test(SUT) is suffered from interations faults such as option compliant, testers want to design. As . Efficenet test space is desired when . To handle this problem, the art of  is to design a t-way covering array, which can cover all the t-way , just using small size of test cases. In this paper, however, we conjecture that the covering array is somewhat reduntant with respect to fault locating. The main reason for the reduntance the we find is the framework it takes is not efficent, traditional works will first generate a covering array to detect if any failing is triggered by any test case, and then pick these failing test case to further locating. In CT, most locating teachinques is just to generate addtional test cases to isolate the MFS. We find two shortcoming for this framework 1: if we had first identify some MFS, we do not need to generate any test case to conatin them, further, any combination contain this MFS will not need to be covered, 2: if we do not genrate, the extra test cases will support some coverage is that when we first already covered. So for this two points, in this paper, we propose a new framework to make the generating process and isolating process more tightly so that the isolating process and generating process will better utilize each other. We have done some emprical studies on several open-source software and found that our new frame work can significantly reduce the test cases.
%Combinatorial testing(CT) is proven to be effective to reveal the potential failures caused by the interaction of the inputs or options of the System Under Test(SUT). A key problem in CT is to isolate the failure-inducing combinations of the related failure as it can facilitate the debugging efforts by reducing the scope of code that needs to be inspected. Many algorithms has been proposed to identify such combinations, however, most of these studies either just consider the condition of one fault or ignore masking effects among multiple faults which can bias their identified results. In this paper, we analysed how the masking effect of multiple faults affect on the isolation of failure-inducing combinations. We further give a strategy of selecting test cases to alleviate this impact, which works by pruning these test cases that may trigger masking effect and replacing them with no-masking-effect ones. The test case selecting process repeated until we get enough information to isolate the failure-inducing combinations. We conducted some empirical studies on several open-source software. The result of the studies shows that multiple faults as well as the masking effects do exist in real software and our approach can assist combinatorial-based failure-inducing identifying methods to get a better result when handling multiple faults in SUT.

\section{Introduction}

Modern software is designed modular, platform-cross, language-cross and configurable. Although the sophisticated design can make the system more flexible and more powerful, it also makes the testing task a challenging work. This is because the candidate factors that can influence the system's behaviour, e.g., possible configuration options, system inputs, message events and the like, increases rapidly, and what's worse, the interactions between these factors can also crash the system, e.g., the compatibility problems. In consideration of the scale of the possible configurations, inputs, events, and their possible interactions(we call them the interactions space) of the real industrial software, to test all the possible combination of all the possible factors is not feasible, and even it is possible, it is also wasting as numerous interactions do not provide any useful information.

Empirical studies shows that the effective interaction space is not of small size. Cohen[] studies the , and find 70 ~ 100 can be. []Shows that to get a some coverage, only a small subset of all the configuration is needed. To this aim,

Typically, when applying CT in practice, there are four testing stages that should be cated as in figure. At the very early of the testing work, engineers should characterize which options and what inputs , i.e., to identify the factors and their possible values. This stage is labor-consuming, at least in the initial testing. The second stage is to generate a bunch of test cases to meet some criteria. In CT, the most common scenario is to cover all the iterations with the factors in the interactions no more than a prior fixed number -- t, in such way, the test suites of CT is also called the t-way covering array.  The third testing stage is to fault localization, i.e., to isolate the failure-inducing interactions which owes to those failures triggered in those test cases in these test cases. The final stage is to evaluate the quality of the test cases.

This conventional CT framework is simple and straight forward, however, we conjecture, it is not he suiable choices and not the choices for most test engineers.  The first,   Second, and most importantly, is.

For this, we.

%Software system are growing more and more complexity, the testing is needed. Nowadays, the bugs are not the single factor-bug, that is, it is . To detect and isolate such a is hard, for we could not easily know which interaction of from so many. The first, how to detect, the second, even if we have detected, .


%
%Combinatorial testing is a proposing testing technique to handle such problem. The testing object-- covering array is a well designed test suite, which can cover each possible interaction with just a small or reasonable size. When one or more test cases trigger some fault, it take the isolating.asdlajsdlas-d=

%In CT it is a pri-critira that the test suite must be , and then using to trigger. This framework is straight and simple, however, we conjecture in this paper that this would be more redundant inspect of fault debugging. Through a series experiment on empirical study, we observe that, there is two main : right . wrong .   This redundant can make the tester to test more unnecessary test cases, which is a wasting of computing resource.
%
%So in this paper, we propose a new and really intuial CT fault detecting and isolating framework (CTDI), which combine the more tightly. In detail our framework, handles two main . For we find . we make it as constraint, and feedback to the generating. The second, as we can generate many extra test cases, for these passing test cases, we use them as seed to let them in the generating process. The ended criteria is some coverage is reached.
%
%Our new CT is .
%
%We have imply , and find our approach can .



%
%With the increasing complexity and size of modern software, many factors, such as input parameters and configuration options, can influence the behaviour of the SUT. The unexpected faults caused by the interaction among these factors can make testing such software a big challenge if the interaction space is too large. One remedy for this problem is combinatorial testing, which systematically sample the interaction space and select a relatively small set of test cases that cover all the valid iterations with the number of factors involved in the interaction no more than a prior fixed integer, i.e., the \emph{strength} of the interaction.
%
%Once failures are detected, it is desired to isolate the failure-inducing combinations in these failing test cases. This task is important in CT as it can facilitate the debugging efforts by reducing the code scope that needed to inspected.

\section{Motivating example}
Combinatorial testing can effectively detect the failures caused by the interactions between various options or inputs of the SUT. Covering arrays, the test suite generated by this technique can cover each combination of the options at least once. We conjecture, however, although covering array can effectively, in practice, covering array was too much for detecting and locating the error in particular software.

As an motivating example, we looked through the following scenarios for detecting and locating the errors in the SUT.

Too much redundant fault test cases:


Too much redundant right test cases:

\section{Background}
This section presents some definitions and propositions to give a formal model for the FCI problem.

\subsection{Failure-inducing combinations in CT}

Assume that the SUT is influenced by \emph{n} parameters, and each parameter $p_{i}$ has $a_{i}$ discrete values from the finite set $V_{i}$, i.e., $a_{i}$ = $|V_{i}|$ ($i$ = 1,2,..n). Some of the definitions below are originally defined in .

\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
A \emph{test case} of the SUT is an array of \emph{n} values, one for each parameter of the SUT, which is denoted as a \emph{n}-tuple ($v_{1}$, $v_{2}$,...,$v_{n}$), where $v_{1}\in V_{1}$, $v_{2} \in V_{2}$ ... $v_{n} \in V_{n}$.
\end{definition}

In practice, these parameters in the test case can represent many factors, such as input variables, run-time options, building options or various combination of them. We need to execute the SUT with these test cases to ensure the correctness of the behaviour of the software.

%\begin{definition}
We consider the fact that the abnormally executing test cases as a \emph{fault}. It can be a thrown exception, compilation error, assertion failure or constraint violation. When faults are triggered by some test cases, what is desired is to figure out the cause of these faults, and hence some subsets of this test case should be analysed.
%\end{definition}

%Figuring out the test case as well as the executing result is usually not enough to analyse the source of the bug, especially when there are too many parameters we need to care in this test case. In this circumstance, we need to study some subsets of this test case, so we need the following definition:

%Figuring out the execution outcomes of test cases must reveal the presence of faulty interactions among those considered. However, the location and magnitude of the fault is still far from clear, especially when there are too many parameters we need to care in this test case. Hence, we need to study some subsets of this test case, which can help isolate the cause of failures.

\begin{definition}
For the SUT, the \emph{n}-tuple (-,$v_{n_{1}}$,...,$v_{n_{k}}$,...)is called a \emph{k}-value \emph{combination} ($0 < k \leq n $) when some k parameters have fixed values and the others can take on their respective allowable values, represented as ``-".

In effect a test case itself is a k-value \emph{combination}, when k = n. Furthermore, if a test case contain a \emph{combination}, i.e., every fixed value in the combination is in this test case, we say this test case \emph{hits} the \emph{combination}.
%, which can be denoted as $k-value\  combination \in T$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
let $c_{l}$ be a \emph{l}-value combination, $c_{m}$ be an \emph{m}-value combination in SUT and $l < m$. If all the fixed parameter values in $c_{l}$ are also in $c_{m}$, then $c_{m}$ \emph{subsumes} $c_{l}$. In this case we can also say that $c_{l}$ is a \emph{sub-combination} of $c_{m}$ and $c_{m}$ is a \emph{parent-combination} of $c_{l}$, which can be denoted as $c_{l} \prec  c_{m}$.
\end{definition}

For example, in the motivation example section, the 2-value combination (-, 4, 4, -) is a sub-combination of the 3-value combination (-, 4, 4, 5), that is, (-,4,4,-) $\prec$ (-,4,4,5).

\begin{definition}
If all test cases contain a combination, say $c$, trigger a particular fault, say $F$, then we call this combination $c$ the \emph{faulty combination} for $F$. Additionally, if none sub-combination of $c$ is the \emph{faulty combination} for $F$, we then call the combination $c$ the \emph{minimal faulty combination} for $F$ (It is also called Minimal failure-causing schema(MFS) in ).

%Based on this, if a test case $t$ hit such a failure-inducing combination, say $c(F)$, it should trigger the fault $F$, for which the test case can be put as $t(F)$
\end{definition}

In fact, MFS and \emph{minimal faulty combinations} are identical to the failure-inducing combinations we discussed previously. Figuring it out can eliminate all details that are irrelevant for causing the failure and hence facilitate the debugging efforts.
